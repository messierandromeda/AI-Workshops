# deepset Social Budget Policy

## 1. Purpose and Objectives

At deepset, we believe that strong human connections are a key ingredient for effective collaboration, innovation, and a healthy company culture. The Social Budget exists to support these values by encouraging regular social interaction among deepsetters in a relaxed, non-work-focused context.

The objectives of the Social Budget are to:

* Encourage regular social interaction and team bonding
* Support both on-site and remote team activities
* Promote inclusivity, well-being, and cross-team collaboration
* Strengthen deepset’s culture in a sustainable and transparent way

## 2. Scope and Eligibility

The Social Budget applies to all deepset employees (“deepsetters”).

* Each deepsetter is allocated a fixed monthly budget.
* The budget can only be used for **social activities involving at least one other deepsetter**.
* The budget is intended for team-based or small-group activities and **not for individual or personal expenses**.

---

## 3. Budget Allocation

* **Budget amount:** €50 per employee per month
* The Social Budget falls under your **team budget**.
* Unused budget does not automatically roll over unless explicitly agreed otherwise by Finance or People Operations.

## 4. Eligible Social Activities

The Social Budget can be used for a wide range of social activities, provided they have a clear social or team-building purpose.

Examples of eligible activities include (but are not limited to):

* Team lunches (on-site or remote)
* Coffee, drinks, or informal meetups
* Sports or wellness activities (e.g. yoga classes, bouldering)

Activities should be inclusive and considerate of team diversity, time zones, and accessibility needs.

## 5. Meal-Specific Guidelines

To ensure fairness and consistency, the following rules apply when the Social Budget is used for meals:

* The **maximum reimbursable amount is €10 per person**.
* Meal-based social activities must take place **between 12:30 and 13:30 (local time)**.
* Meals outside this time window (e.g. dinners or late lunches) are **not covered** by the Social Budget.

---

## 6. Budget Management and Approval

* The Social Budget is managed by your **team manager**.
* Managers may plan or approve social activities **in agreement with the team**.
* Teams are encouraged to openly discuss how the budget is used to ensure fairness and transparency.

---

## 7. Cost Center and Expense Reporting

* **Cost Center:** Use your **Team Cost Center**

  * ❌ Do **not** use the People Cost Center
* The person organizing the activity is responsible for uploading the expense under their team cost center.

Each expense submission must include:

* Name(s) of the involved deepsetter(s)
* Description of the activity
* Month of the activity

**Example:**
*Jack and Dylan, Beers for party, March 2024*

## 8. Compliance and Final Notes

* All Social Budget spending must comply with deepset’s general expense, conduct, and compliance policies.
* Inappropriate, excessive, or non-social expenses may be rejected.
* When in doubt, deepsetters should consult their manager before committing to an expense.

The Social Budget is a shared resource designed to bring people together. We trust deepsetters to use it responsibly, inclusively, and in the spirit of collaboration.
